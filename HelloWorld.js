/** I'm currently at the below url while studying JS and using firefox/scratchpad as my developer tools:

* http://creativejs.com/tutorials/create-an-ipad-optimised-game/index.html
* surprisingly it took me a while to figure out the way JS works. Study how the DOM works, and JS interact, then create a simple
* animation as step 1.
