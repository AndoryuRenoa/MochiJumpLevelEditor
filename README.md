# MochiJumpLevelEditor

Current Status: MJLE-0.2.4

hosted via google cloud @ http://mochijump.com/

Email App Created. It is currently a seperate app from the main one. Considering combining them...

Next up:

*Note: this web app will have to fail at least one more time to determine cause of failure after a period of about a week of continuous running*

I need to change the client to import levels individually, the returnAll api causes a significant increase in CPU usage at this point. This needs to be implemented here in controller and repository classes. I must've removed that prior to last commit.

Should do:

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor
