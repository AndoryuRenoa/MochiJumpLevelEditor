# MochiJumpLevelEditor

Current Status:

Single HTML/JS Page with working "paint" like program

Spring (Java) built application to host the webpage and transfer data to and from MySQL (Incomplete):

Changes JSON Output. example:

["test",[283.5,283.5,425.5],[213.5,213.5,163.5],[5,5,5],[5,5,5]]

i.e. [string,double[],double[],int[],int[]];

Currently working on how to convert this into a POJO

Creating seperate project to test solutions for the above more quickly. Link below:

Note to Future Me:

If this turns into something outside of a single page app use Thymeleaf.
