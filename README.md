Current Status:

Single HTML/JS Page with working "paint" like program

Spring (Java) built application to host the webpage and transfer data to and from MySQL.

Future To Do:

Turn this into a multipage website with user login. For that kind of functionality it would be a good idea to use Thymeleaf.
