# MochiJumpLevelEditor

Current Status:

Single HTML/JS Page with working "paint" like program

Spring (Java) built application to host the webpage and transfer data to and from MySQL (Incomplete):

Able to retrieve objects from webpage, Spring controller needs to be reworked for appropriate output and webpage JS needs to be adjusted to include level name to the output. Once that is done the APP will be able to "save" level maps generated inside of it in a meaningful way.


Future To Do:

Turn this into a multipage website with user login. For that kind of functionality it would be a good idea to use Thymeleaf.
