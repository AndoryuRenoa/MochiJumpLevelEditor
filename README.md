Current Status: MJLE-0.2.4

multiple services, including google cloud & AWS entry point is: http://mochijump.com/


Next up:

At the very least warn users the app isn't optimized for mobile. See mobiletester.js

need to resize message textarea it's both too tall and too wide for some resolutions.

*fix typo in modal div*

Create user/password functionality

Should do:

need to change the client to import levels individually, the returnAll api causes a significant increase in CPU usage at this point. This needs to be implemented here in controller and repository classes. I must've removed that prior to last commit.

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor

Want to do:

I kind of want to setup mail server for MochiJump using Apache-James
