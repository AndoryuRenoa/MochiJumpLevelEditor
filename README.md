Current Status: MJLE-0.2.4

Email App Created. It is currently a seperate app from the main one. Considering combining them...

Next up:

Adding emailer app. Google made this difficult enough that the emailer app is going to live on AWS now

Should do:

need to change the client to import levels individually, the returnAll api causes a significant increase in CPU usage at this point. This needs to be implemented here in controller and repository classes. I must've removed that prior to last commit.

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor
