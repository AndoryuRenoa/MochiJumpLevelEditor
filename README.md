# MochiJumpLevelEditor

Current Status: MJLE-0.2.4

hosted via google cloud @ http://mochijump.com/

Next up:

Adding emailer app. Google made this difficult enough that the emailer app is going to live on AWS now

Now it's time to combine landing page and the emailer app!

Should do:

need to change the client to import levels individually, the returnAll api causes a significant increase in CPU usage at this point. This needs to be implemented here in controller and repository classes. I must've removed that prior to last commit.

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor

Want to do:

I kind of want to setup mail server for MochiJump using Apache-James
