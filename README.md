## Notes:

Currently working on setting up http/2 reliably. Using Java 8 may need libtcnative directory

## Future Stuff:

Should do:

need to change the client to import levels individually, the returnAll api causes a significant increase in CPU usage at this point. This needs to be implemented here in controller and repository classes. I must've removed that prior to last commit.

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor
