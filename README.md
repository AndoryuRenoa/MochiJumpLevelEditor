Email App Created. It is currently a seperate app from the main one. Considering combining them...

Next up:

I need to change the client to import levels individually, the returnAll api causes a significant increase in CPU usage at this point. This needs to be implemented here in controller and repository classes. I must've removed that prior to last commit.

Okay, I'm going to attempt to get the emailer app on Google App Engine. I'll rewrite it to use maven as I've read about issues with spring/gradle/jetty 

Should do:

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor
