Email App Created. It is currently a seperate app from the main one. Considering combining them...

Next up:

Okay, I'm going to attempt to get the emailer app on Google App Engine. I'll rewrite it to use maven as I've read about issues with spring/gradle/jetty 

Should do:

add arrows to move view point in level editor

Change alerts & url for level editor
