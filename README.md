# MochiJumpLevelEditor

Current Status:

Single HTML/JS Page with working "paint" like program

Spring (Java) built application to host the webpage and transfer data to and from MySQL (Incomplete):

Able to retrieve JSON from webpage result example:

{"0":{"levelName":"naka","x":611,"y":195,"height":150,"width":150},"1":{"levelName":"naka","x":262,"y":244,"height":150,"width":150}}

Currently working on how to convert this into a POJO

Creating seperate project (housed in questions/WorkingWithJSON) to test solutions for the above more quickly.


Note to Future Me:

If this turns into something outside of a single page app use Thymeleaf.
